# Frontend Development Plan

## Project Overview
Building a modern, responsive frontend for the quotes application using Next.js 14 with App Router, focusing on best practices, reusability, and excellent user experience.

## Backend Analysis Summary
The backend provides:
- **Authentication**: JWT-based user registration/login with profile management
- **Quotes CRUD**: Full CRUD operations with owner-only edit/delete permissions
- **Reactions**: Like/dislike system with toggle functionality
- **Search & Pagination**: Public quote browsing with search and filtering capabilities
- **User Profiles**: Public user profiles and quote collections

## Frontend Architecture Plan

### 1. Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **State Management**: React Context + useReducer for global state
- **HTTP Client**: Built-in fetch API with custom hooks
- **Authentication**: JWT token storage in localStorage with automatic refresh
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **UI Components**: Custom component library with shadcn/ui inspiration

- **Create/Edit Forms**: Rich text editor for quote creation
- **User Dashboard**: Personal quotes management with edit/delete
- **Quote Details**: Individual quote pages with full context

#### Search & Discovery
- **Search Interface**: Advanced search with filters (author, content, date)
- **User Profiles**: Public user pages showing their quotes
- **Responsive Grid**: Mobile-first quote display

#### Reactions System
